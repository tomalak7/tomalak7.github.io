I am theoretical physicist working in various subjects of modern Nuclear and Particle Physics in a close connections to the experiment. As of today, I have significantly contributed to the following research fields: 

1) neutrino cross sections for oscillation experiments,

2) coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering,

3) the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa mixing matrix and neutron decay,
  
4) nucleon form factors,

5) precision physics of simple atoms,

6) nucleon and nuclear structure in large nuclei.

Keywords
------
radiative corrections, neutrino interactions, nucleon structure, cross sections, effective field theory, quantum field theory, quantum electrodynamics, hadron physics, dispersion relations, non-perturbative methods, two-photon exchange.
