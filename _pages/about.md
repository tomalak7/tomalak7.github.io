Special Issue in Journal Universe
------

Special Issue [Neutrino Oscillations and Interactions](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/universe/special_issues/R0P670C0CC) in Universe accepts publication with full and partial fee wavers. Our goal is to capture the current state of the art and progress being made in neutrino physics while illuminating a path toward the field's exciting future. We look forward to receiving your contributions.


About me
------
I am a theoretical physicist working on various subjects in modern Nuclear and Particle Physics, in a close connection to the experiment. 

As of today, I have significantly contributed to the following research areas: 

1) neutrino cross sections for oscillation experiments,

2) coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering,

3) neutron and nuclear beta decay, Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa mixing matrix,
  
4) nucleon form factors,

5) precision physics of simple atoms,

6) nucleon and nuclear structure in large nuclei.


Keywords
------
Radiative corrections, neutrino interactions, nucleon structure, cross sections, effective field theory, low-energy electroweak interactions, quantum field theory, quantum electrodynamics, hadron physics, dispersion relations, non-perturbative methods, two-photon exchange.

Projects and Jobs
------

If you are highly motivated-bachelor/master/PhD student, or postdoc and seeking for opportunities to continue research, please do not hesitate to contact me via [Email](mailto:sashatomalak@icloud.com).

Our group invites applications for one postdoctoral position, starting in 2026. Applicants must hold a PhD in nuclear or particle physics by the time of appointment. The starting date can be negotiated.

The candidates with experience in neutrino physics, QED radiative corrections, precision calculations, effective field theories, low-energy electroweak interactions, lepton scattering, hadron phenomenology, chiral perturbation theory, and nuclear structure are encouraged to apply.

The appointment is initially for two years. Extension to a third year is possible depending on performance, project status, and funding.

Applications received by January 15th, 2026 will receive full consideration. The position will remain open until filled. Applications are accepted at [AJO](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/31194)
